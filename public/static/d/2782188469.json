When I was younger, I was\n    called Antony but things change. What hasn’t changed is my love for\n    computers. My parents sacrificed most of their savings so that I could have\n    a PC at age 3.   Now, I’m a software engineer who aims to pay it forward by\n    providing others with opportunities to code. I combine my love of the web\n    with my eye for  design in order to create tools that enable others to learn\n    new skills. When I’m not coding, I’m teaching Java at local high schools,\n    facilitating engineering summer camps, and hosting web development\n    workshops.\n\n    I’m always seeking new opportunities. Feel free to contact me at\n    emily@computer.org if you’d like to work with me! In addition to money for\n    my tuition, I’m also open to payment in the form of boba and korean bbq.\n    "}}}}]}}}
