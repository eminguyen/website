    about: `Hi I’m Emily!

    But you can call me Emi. When I was younger, I was
    called Antony but things change. What hasn’t changed is my love for
    computers. My parents sacrificed most of their savings so that I could have
    a PC at age 3.   Now, I’m a software engineer who aims to pay it forward by
    providing others with opportunities to code. I combine my love of the web
    with my eye for  design in order to create tools that enable others to learn
    new skills. When I’m not coding, I’m teaching Java at local high schools,
    facilitating engineering summer camps, and hosting web development
    workshops.

    I’m always seeking new opportunities. Feel free to contact me at
    emily@computer.org if you’d like to work with me! In addition to money for
    my tuition, I’m also open to payment in the form of boba and korean bbq.
